# XGBoost Baseline for Trigger Detection at PAN23

## Objective

This project aims to develop an XGBoost baseline model for trigger detection as part of the PAN23 shared task. The script includes functionalities to fit a vectorizer, train the model, and save them to disk. Additionally, it conducts an ablation study to explore the impact of different parameters on model performance, providing insights into optimal hyperparameter settings for enhanced trigger detection accuracy.

## Tasks Accomplished

1. **Implemented XGBoost Classifier**
   - Developed a robust XGBoost classifier to detect triggers using features extracted from text data.

2. **Ablation Study**
   - Conducted an ablation study to optimize hyperparameters (`max_depth`, `learning_rate`) through grid search, enhancing model performance.

3. **Model Persistence**
   - Saved trained XGBoost models and vectorizers to disk for future use and deployment.


### Learning Outcomes

- **Advanced XGBoost Implementation:** Improved understanding of XGBoost algorithm implementation for text classification tasks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Enhanced skills in hyperparameter optimization using grid search and validation metrics.
- **Practical Model Deployment:** Learned best practices in saving and deploying trained machine learning models.

This project not only contributed to advancing knowledge in trigger detection but also provided practical experience in machine learning model development and optimization.
